# A Simple Todo App created with ReactJs

This todo app is hosted on [netlify](https://amt-todolist.netlify.app/).

## How It Works

-- You can type a new todo into the input field and click the **Add** button.

-- If you click the Add button without typing anything into the input field, you will get an error which will disappear as soon as you start typing.

-- After adding the todos, a **Clear All** button will appear at the bottom of the list. When you click the button, the list is cleared and when you click the **Undo** button, the list is back on the page.

-- Each todo has a checkbox to indicate its *completion* and an **x** button to remove the todo once it is completed. If you click the **x** button without checking the box, you will get an error.

-- When you remove all the todos using the **x** button, the **Undo** button appears and when you click it, your todos are back on the page.
